# House-price-prediction-machine-learning
When we examine the evaluation metrics obtained for
advanced regression models, we can see that they exhibit
similar behavior. This shows that we can choose any of
these advanced models for house price prediction compared
to the basic model. Therefore, we can use random forests,
neural networks and particle swarms to further improve the
accuracy of our predictions. Advanced modeling techniques
like optimization have been used. These methods provide more
sophisticated approaches to modeling complex relationships in
data and produce more accurate results
